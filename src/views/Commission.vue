        After receiving the payment, I will start the sketch in few days. This sketch will be sent to you. If you have ANY modifications to suggest, this is the moment to do them. Once the sketch is validated, I will start the line and the color, according to what you commissioned for.

        I have the full right to decline a commission without justification.
